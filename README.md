# arduino-automation-with-LDR-and-Water-sensor
This program uses a water sensor to detect the presence of water and a light sensor to automate servo motor working.
When the light sensor detects light and the water sensor does not detect water,
the program will activate a servo motor to rotate 90 degrees in one direction.
If the water sensor detects water,
the program will activate the servo motor to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction.
This program can be used to automatically shelter clothes when it starts raining and remove them from shelter when it stops.
